Immerse yourself in the dark and fascinating world of the game, which draws inspiration from cult titles such as 'The Binding of Isaac' and 'Darkest Dungeon'. In this suspenseful adventure, you'll embark on dangerous journeys to exotic and mysterious locations where every corner hides unknown dangers and abundant treasures.

Face hordes of terrifying monsters in dynamic and challenging clashes, where only true strategy and quick reactions can ensure your survival. Gain experience and riches that will enable you to develop your character's skills and adapt them to your own play style.

Your camp is your refuge and bastion, which you can upgrade and expand to become stronger and more efficient. Invest in new amenities, grow plants from captured seeds, create potions that produce a variety of effects, and discover forgotten technologies to increase your chances of success in increasingly fierce confrontations.

Do you have what it takes to uncover the secrets hidden in the depths and survive in a world where each new level is more difficult than the last?
